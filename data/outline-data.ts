      "Being creative is a set of skills.\n\nA skill is a set of behaviors (or ways of thinking) that you learn through practice and experience.\n\nSo, if you spend the time learning and practicing the skills of creativity, you can become more creative.\n\nA practice is the repeated exercise or performance of an activity with the goal of improving or maintaining proficiency in it. It involves the dedicated and systematic repetition of actions to acquire, hone, or enhance one's skills.\n\nThere are many ways to practice creativity; we will focus on general practices vs specific practices. For example, awareness and how to be aware vs. how to draw or use Photoshop.",
